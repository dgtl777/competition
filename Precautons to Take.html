        <h1>Tips for avoiding Blizzards</h1>
    </header><br>
    <h3>Now that you know know what Blizzards can do, you need to know how to safe when a Blizzard might occur! </h3>
    <br>
    <h2>1.Stay Inside</h2><br>
    <h3>Staying off the roads and remaining indoors is the best way to avoid winter hazards, <br>and the perfect chance
        to whip up some soup, but once the wind and the snow taper off, don’t be afraid to step outside and enjoy the
        snow.</h3>
    <h2>2. Use Flashlights Not Candles</h2>
    <h3>During a power outage, avoid using candles if possible. Flash lights are a much safer alternative, especially in
        a household with children and/or pets.</h3>
    <h2>3. Prepare a Blizzard Survival Kit</h2>
    <h3>Stock a bag with all the essentials that can help you outlast a long power outage. Batteries, flashlights, a
        battery-operated radio, bottled water, canned goods, any medications you take.<br>But cater your survival kit to
        your own personal needs.</h3>

    <h2>4.Charge Your Cellphone</h2>
    <h3>The importance of a cellphone can’t be overstated. These are the ultimate emergency devices, so make sure yours
        is charged and ready to go.</h3>
    <h2>5. Watch for Frostbite and Hypothermia</h2>
    <h3>Symptoms for hypothermia include dizziness, exhaustion, and severe shivering. Symptoms for frostbite include
        numbness; flushed gray, white, blue, or yellow skin discoloration; or waxy-feeling skin. <br>If you think you’re
        afflicted with either, call 911.</h3><br>
