    <h3>A blizzard is a cruel snowstorm characterized by strong continuous winds of at least 56 km/h (35 mph) and
        lasting for a lengthy period of time—typically three hours or more.
        A ground blizzard is a weather condition where snow is not falling but loose snow on the ground is lifted and
        blown by mighty winds. Always check the weather forecast for these deadly natural phenominons. Blizzard's snow's
        can reach pile up and it's wind's can reach high speeds.
        Blizzards can have an immense size and usually stretch to hundreds or thousands of kilometres</h3><br><br>

    <div id="Fact">Fact:<br>
        The 1972 Iran blizzard, which caused 4,000 reported deaths, was the deadliest blizzard in recorded history.
        Dropping as much as 26 feet (7.9 m) of snow, it completely covered 200 villages.</div>
    <h3>We will be looking at 2 types of basic blizzards in this page. Ground and regular.
        The main difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no
        precipitation is produced at the time,
        but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface.The Australia
        Bureau of Meteorology describes a blizzard as,
        "Violent and very cold wind which is laden with snow, some part, at least, of which has been raised from snow
        covered ground."This description seems as a ground Blizzard's.Blizzards can also make lots of snow.
        Up to 2-6 inches per hour.Incredible!The highest amont of snow recorded was 6.3 feet in one day which was in the
        U.S Colarado, Silver Lake on April 14 and 15 1921. But that's just for one day the snow can pile all the way up
        to 790cm Winds can also reach up to 129km per hour!
        Blizzards are very dangerous and incredible! Make sure too know what to do if a Blizzard ever strikes your area.
