    <h2>The Avengers basially consist of 6 super heroes: Iron-man(middle), Captain America(Right), Hawkeye (Left),
        Thor(middle Right), Black Widow (Top), Hulk (middle left).
        The leader of the Avengers is Captain America, AKA Steve Rogers. His special Abilities are Super strength and
        combat skills. He was experimented in the 20th century, and got injected with the super-soldier serum. But when
        taking down his enemy, Red skull he had plane crashed in ice, only to be disconvered decades later.
        Then their is Iron-man. Iron man AKA Tony Stark. He used to be a weapons company CEO until he had found out what
        his weapons were doing he started making Iron man suits to save people rather than use bonbs. He made his first
        suit in a Cave out of scratch. Then after defeating his arch nemesis he made tons more suits.
        Then there are Hawkeye and Black Widow, AKA Clint Barton and Natasha Romanoff. They both are agents of
        S.H.I.E.L.D, and have various skillsets and equipment. Hawkeye is good with arrows and Black Widow is good at
        combat.
        Last but certainly not least are Thor and Hulk. Known as the 2 most powerful Avengers, Thor from Asgard is the
        wielder of Mjolner, his hammer. You can also actually call Thor an Alien. But Hulk on the other hand AKA Bruce
        Banner got hit with gamma rays and got the habit of turning into the Hulk when angry. <br><br><a
