    <h3>The Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of
        architecture Ernő Rubik.From 1971 to 1979, Rubik was a professor of architecture at the Budapest College of
        Applied Arts.In the spring of 1974 Rubik became obsessed with finding a way to model three-dimensional movement
        to his students.I was searching for a way to demonstrate 3D movement to my students and one day found myself
        staring into the River Danube, looking at how the water moved around the pebbles. This became the inspiration
        for the cube's twisting mechanism. That's why he invented the Rubiks Cube.Rubik assembled his first cube puzzle
        in 1974 and called it the Magic Cube. After a toy agent pitched the puzzle to Ideal Toy & Novelty Company, it
        renamed the puzzle Rubik's Cube and began putting it in stores in 1980.</h3><br>
