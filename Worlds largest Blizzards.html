    <h2>1993 North American storm complex</h2>
    <h3>The 1993 North American storm complex, also known as the (Great) Blizzard of 1993, or the Storm of the Century,
        was a large cyclonic storm that occurred on March to March 15, 1993, on the East Coast of North America. <br>
        It is unique both because of its intensity as well as its massive size and wide reaching effect.The storm system
        was an anomaly in nature. <br>
        The development began when a blast of cold arctic air (a strong dip in the strong jet stream structure) pushed
        down through the Plains into the Gulf of Mexico before pushing back up the eastern seaboard.</h3><br>
