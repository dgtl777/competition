    <h3>The first step for a begginer to solve the Rubiks Cube is to make a cross by making what Cubers call, the daisy.
        To make the daisy first find the yellow middle piece in your cube. Then put 4 white edges beside it. After that
        look at it in the angle which the image above is shown. Then match the edge pieces of the same color onto the
        middle pieces. </h3><br>

        alt="">
    <h3>Then after matching the middle and edge piece, turn the front face 180deg right or left. Then keep doing the
        process and flip the rubiks cube to find a white cross or plus like this one.</h3><br>

    <h3>Before we move on to the next step here are the Rubiks Cube algorithm moves you might be using.</h3><br>

    <h3>You might want to mostly practice the r's and l's in the chart above. But still practice every move there.</h3>

    <h2>First Layer and Bottom face</h2>
    <h3>First in the goal of the next step we will solve the bottom layer of the Rubiks Cube or first layer. flip the
        side of the cube with cross to the bottom like the image down. It is also the end form of this step.</h3><br>

        alt=""><br>
    <h3>Sorry We didnt find photo of cross at bottom but you should keep it like that. After you have done that you need
        to find the corner that will fit between the colored edges like the photo above and then you need to repeat
        U,R,U',R' until corner piece fits repeat this for all the corners.If the corner i at left then do U,L,U',L'.
    </h3><br>
    <h2>Second layer</h2>

    <img id="SL" src="https://applied1tech.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/secondlayer.png?w=900" alt="">
    <h3>To do this we are going to show you another algorithm sheet now. This is the second layer. You need to see the
        algorithm sheet which is above.the image below is the result of completing second layer.</h3><br>

    <h2>Last layer (Part 1)</h2>
    <img id="OLLIMG" src="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/images/3/37/OLLinfo.png" alt="">
    <br>
    <h3>We are dividing the last layer step in 2 parts, so it can be easy. First you need to create the yellow face. For
        doing that we eed to create the yellow cross withut disturbing white face</h3><br>
    <img src="https://easycube3.net/images/possible_starting_positions_1.jpg" alt=""><br>
    <h3>These are the cases that you will get after doing the second layer. The algorithm for these cases are same.
        After yellow dot you will get the l shape. To get the l shape you need to do F U R U' R' F'.Then aftert the L
        shape you will get the bar or the line. For getting the line F U R U' R' F'. After the line you will get the
        yellow cross. Again F U R U' R' F' </h3><br>
    <img id="yellowcross" src="https://rubiks-cube-solver.com/how-to-solve/12-yellow-cross-solved.png" alt=""><br>
    <h3>After the cross you need to do the yellow face</h3><br>

    <h3>After this you will get the yellow now your ready for the part 2 of The last layer</h3><br>
